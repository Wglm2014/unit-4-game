# Cristal Game
Is a memory game that presents three buttons with the **form of crystals**. When the user clicks on the **button play or a any crystal button** the game begins and presents a random number between 19 and 120, each crystal is assaing a ramdom number that when clicking on a crystal button is added, if the total match the number randomly presented to the user, the user gets a point, if the addition totals more than the random number, at some point during each game the user looses that match. The game can be reset at any time the user desires.

This project is good to learn the use of random numbers
